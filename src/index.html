  <h2 class="poem_title">Early Love</h2>
  <h4 class="author_name">by John Clare</h4>
  <p class="poem_full">The Spring of life is o'er with me,
     And love and all gone by;
     Like broken bough upon yon tree,
     I'm left to fade and die.
     Stern ruin seized my home and me,
     And desolate's my cot:
     Ruins of halls, the blasted tree,
     Are emblems of my lot. <br></p>

     <p>I lived and loved, I woo'd and won,
     Her love was all to me,
     But blight fell o'er that youthful one,
     And like a blasted tree
     I withered, till I all forgot
     But Mary's smile on me;
     She never lived where love was not,
     And I from bonds was free.<br></p>

     <p>The Spring it clothed the fields with pride,
     When first we met together;
     And then unknown to all beside
     We loved in sunny weather;
     We met where oaks grew overhead,
     And whitethorns hung with may;
     Wild thyme beneath her feet was spread,
     And cows in quiet lay.<br></p>

     <p>I thought her face was sweeter far
     Than aught I'd seen before--
     As simple as the cowslips are
     Upon the rushy moor:
     She seemed the muse of that sweet spot,
     The lady of the plain,
     And all was dull where she was not,
     Till we met there again.<br></p>
