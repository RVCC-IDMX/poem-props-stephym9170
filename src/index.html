          <p>
            The Spring of life is o'er with me,
            <br />And love and all gone by; <br />Like broken bough upon yon
            tree, <br />I'm left to fade and die. <br />Stern ruin seized my
            home and me, <br />And desolate's my cot: <br />Ruins of halls, the
            blasted tree, <br />Are emblems of my lot. <br />
          </p>

          <p>
            I lived and loved, I woo'd and won,<br />
            Her love was all to me,<br />
            But blight fell o'er that youthful one,<br />
            And like a blasted tree<br />
            I withered, till I all forgot<br />
            But Mary's smile on me;<br />
            She never lived where love was not,<br />
            And I from bonds was free.<br />
          </p>

          <p>
            The Spring it clothed the fields with pride,<br />
            When first we met together;<br />
            And then unknown to all beside<br />
            We loved in sunny weather;<br />
            We met where oaks grew overhead,<br />
            And whitethorns hung with may; <br />
            Wild thyme beneath her feet was spread,<br />
            And cows in quiet lay.<br />
          </p>

          <p>
            I thought her face was sweeter far<br />
            Than aught I'd seen before--<br />
            As simple as the cowslips are<br />
            Upon the rushy moor:<br />
            She seemed the muse of that sweet spot,<br />
            The lady of the plain,<br />
            And all was dull where she was not,<br />
            Till we met there again.<br />
